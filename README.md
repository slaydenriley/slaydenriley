## Hi there, I'm Riley. 👨‍💻

- 💻 I'm a graduate of Flatiron School, working with Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and React/Redux
- 🛠 Currently searching for work in software engineering!
- 🌲 When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the woods: ⛷ skiing, ⛰ hiking, 🏕 camping, 🎣 fly-fishing, or 🧗‍♀️ climbing. 
- Or, I'll be playing the banjo 🪕.
